A repository containing materials of sharing session that done by me during internship experience at GOJEK and fulltime experience at DOKU. I tried to share the notion of doing hypothesis testing using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and T-Test. Notebook and slide attached. Any suggestions are welcome!
