## sesi-berbagi
A repository containing materials of sharing session that done by me during my internship, professional working, and researching experience. I tried to share several topics that I have learned, including the notion of doing hypothesis testing and reviewing about video captioning papers. Some notebooks, slides, and videos are attached. Any suggestions are welcome!
